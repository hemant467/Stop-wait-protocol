OUTPUT :

enter the window size : 3
enter the number of frames to transmit : 5
enter 5 frames : 12 5 89 4 6
with sliding window protocol frames will be sent in following manner
after sending %d frames at each stage sender waits for acknowlwdgement sent by sender
12 5 89
Acknowledgement of above frames sent is received by receiver
4 6
